    <h1>Jasmine Rice</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Named after the sweet-smelling jasmine flower, jasmine rice is a long grain rice native to Thailand with a delicate floral and buttery scent. The secret to cooking it perfectly is getting the right ratio of water to rice. Typically, the instructions on the package call for 1-1/2 cups water for every 1 cup of rice. That’s fine if you like your rice “al dente” but I prefer mine soft, so I always add a bit more water. Many recipes call for rinsing the grains before cooking but I don’t think it’s necessary — even when you rinse jasmine rice, the grains have a slightly sticky texture and cling together.</p>
